# Web Development

## Purpose
This repository stores the websites I built as part of a front-end course at my university.
Yeshiva University, COM3780

## Foreword
These projects are a subset of the projects given to University of Washington computer science students. The projects varied in diffuculty; each successive project added more features as well as more web technologies.

## Development/Deployment
I used `xampp`, a cross-platform web server to serve my websites locally for devlopment. I then uploaded the files to a remote server hosted by my professor using `FileZilla`. That server is no longer hosting these pages; I am in the process of creating a website which will display my front-end portfolio (amongst other personal projects) and all of these pages will be available to see.
