  	{ "review": "Expect no intelligence or subtlety here, but if you're willing to put up with the sheer ridiculousness of it all, you might enjoy wallowing in Bekmambetov's shameless exhibition of narrative lunacy and technical fireworks in this movie.",

  	{ "review": "The result is a film that feels more like the ridiculous Will Smith Wild Wild West and less like Bekmambetov's clever Night Watch.",

  	{ "review": "Starting well and culminating in a lackluster second half, it is far too streamlined and spotty to satisfy as anything more than a pulpy slice of summer movie inconsequence.",

  	{ "review": "This movie just made Steven Spielberg's life easier because his Lincoln biopic coming out in December wil definitely be the better of these two films. This could have been fun, it never settles in what it wants to be and ultimately fails.",

  	{ "review": "The feature doesn't have the twinkle in its eye to accurately blend SuperLincoln with TrueLincoln into a loving, ax-swinging whole.",

  	{ "review": "If ever there was an 'either you're in or out' movie in 2012, it's definitely this one and if you're in, it just might be the most guilty pleasure of the year.",

  	{ "review": "This movie is even sillier than I thought it would be. You talk about shark-jumping, fridge-nuking. I have a new one for you, horse leaping! Once that happens, that's when it goes off the rails and begins it's descent into Movie Hell.",
