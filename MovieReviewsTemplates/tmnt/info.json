		  "excerpt": "Ditching the cheeky, self-aware wink that helped to excuse the concept's inherent corniness, the movie attempts to look polished and 'cool,' but the been-there animation can't compete with the then-cutting-edge puppetry of the 1990 live-action movie."},
		{ "critic": "Todd Gilchrist", "affiliation": "IGN Movies", 
		  "verdict": "fresh",
		  "excerpt": "TMNT is a fun, action-filled adventure that will satisfy longtime fans and generate a legion of new ones."},

		{ "critic": "Jeannette Catsoulis", "affiliation": "New York Times", 
		  "verdict": "rotten",
		  "excerpt": "The turtles themselves may look prettier, but are no smarter; torn irreparably from their countercultural roots, our superheroes on the half shell have been firmly co-opted by the industry their creators once sought to spoof."},

		  "verdict": "rotten",
		  "excerpt": "Impersonally animated and arbitrarily plotted, the story appears to have been made up as the filmmakers went along."},
		{ "critic": "Mark Palermo", "affiliation": "Coast (Halifax, Nova Scotia)", 
		  "verdict": "fresh",
		  "excerpt": "The striking use of image and motion allows each sequence to leave an impression. It's an accomplished restart to this franchise."},
		{ "critic": "Steve Rhodes", "affiliation": "Internet Reviews", 
		  "verdict": "rotten",
		  "excerpt": "The script feels like it was computer generated. This mechanical presentation lacks the cheesy charm of the three live action films."}
